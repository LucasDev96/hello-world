# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository, made while following along with their guide on making repositories and branches.

I'm currently just a wannabe dev, that's done way too many tutorials trying to figure out what I want to do. I'm at the beginning of The Odin Project right now and I'm looking forward to what the future has in store.
